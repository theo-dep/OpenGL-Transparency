# Third Party

## BSP

From https://github.com/roever/BSP/tree/master commit 8226416075255c227e37cc1fc7e55b4af5acf1ed and adapted with GLM.

Another algorithm by [Alan Baylist (2001)](https://www.alsprogrammingresource.com/bsp.html) would probably work but it is much memory consumer. Saved in bsptrees.zip.
